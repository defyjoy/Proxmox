# RKE2 Playbook - Fix Applied ✅

## 🔧 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: The initial implementation incorrectly referenced `lablabs.rke2` as an Ansible **collection**, but it's actually an Ansible **role**.

**Error**:
```
ERROR! Failed to resolve the requested dependencies map. Could not satisfy the following requirements:
* lablabs.rke2:>=2.0.0 (direct request)
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Updated `requirements.yml`**
```yaml
# Before (WRONG - tried to install as collection)
collections:
  - name: lablabs.rke2
    version: ">=2.0.0"

# After (CORRECT - install as role)
roles:
  - name: lablabs.rke2
    src: https://github.com/lablabs/ansible-role-rke2
```

### 2. **Updated Playbook** (`playbooks/rke2-ansible.yaml`)
- Changed from using sub-roles (`lablabs.rke2.rke2_common`, etc.) to the main role
- Added `vars_files: - ../defaults/main.yml` to load configuration
- Fixed variable references (e.g., `rke2_api_ip` → using inventory IP)
- Simplified to use single role that handles both masters and workers

### 3. **Updated All Documentation**
- `docs/RKE2-SETUP.md` - Role installation instructions
- `docs/RKE2-DEPLOYMENT.md` - References to role vs collection
- `RKE2-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - Architecture updates

## 🚀 Verification

All checks passing:

```bash
✅ Role installed successfully
✅ Playbook syntax check passed
✅ Configuration loaded from defaults/main.yml
✅ Inventory properly configured
```

## 🎯 Ready to Use!

### Installation Confirmed
```bash
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

Starting galaxy role install process
- extracting lablabs.rke2 to /roles/lablabs.rke2
- lablabs.rke2 was installed successfully ✅
```

### Syntax Check Passed
```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/rke2-ansible.yaml --syntax-check

playbook: playbooks/rke2-ansible.yaml ✅
```

## 📋 Quick Start (Updated)

### 1. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check that the role is installed
ansible-galaxy role list | grep rke2
# Output: - lablabs.rke2, (version)

# Or check the directory
ls -la roles/lablabs.rke2/
```

### 2. Review Configuration
```bash
# Check your defaults
cat defaults/main.yml | head -20

# Important: Change the default token!
nano defaults/main.yml
# Find: rke2_token: defaultSecret12345
# Change to something secure!
```

### 3. Deploy Cluster
```bash
# Option 1: Full deployment (recommended)
task cluster

# Option 2: Just RKE2 (if VMs already exist)
task rke2

# Option 3: Dry run first
task rke2-check
```

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### Architecture
```
defaults/main.yml (350+ variables)
      ↓ (loaded via vars_files)
playbooks/rke2-ansible.yaml
      ↓ (uses role)
roles/lablabs.rke2/
      ↓ (deploys based on inventory groups)
Masters (k8s_cluster → masters)
Workers (k8s_cluster → workers)
```

### The Role's Behavior
The `lablabs.rke2` role automatically:
- Detects if a node is in `masters` group → installs RKE2 server
- Detects if a node is in `workers` group → installs RKE2 agent
- Configures networking, CNI, and services
- Joins workers to the control plane

## 📝 Key Differences: Role vs Collection

### Ansible Collection (what we thought it was)
```yaml
# Collections have multiple roles/plugins
collections:
  - name: namespace.collection
    
# Used like:
roles:
  - role: namespace.collection.role_name
```

### Ansible Role (what it actually is)
```yaml
# Roles are standalone
roles:
  - name: namespace.role
    src: github.com/...

# Used like:
roles:
  - role: namespace.role
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If you see "role not found"
```bash
task install
# Or
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force
```

### If deployment fails
```bash
# Check configuration is loaded
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/rke2-ansible.yaml --check -v

# SSH to a node and check logs
ssh root@192.168.68.100
journalctl -u rke2-server -f
```

### If variables are undefined
The playbook now loads `defaults/main.yml` via `vars_files`, so all your variables should be available.

## 📚 Updated Documentation

All documentation has been updated to reflect the role-based approach:

- ✅ `requirements.yml` - Correct role syntax
- ✅ `playbooks/rke2-ansible.yaml` - Uses single role
- ✅ `docs/RKE2-SETUP.md` - Role installation
- ✅ `docs/RKE2-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Role references
- ✅ `docs/RKE2-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
- ✅ `RKE2-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - Architecture overview
- ✅ `README.md` - Main project README

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before deploying to your cluster:

- [x] Role installed (`task install`) ✅
- [x] Playbook syntax valid ✅
- [x] Configuration file exists (`defaults/main.yml`) ✅
- [x] Inventory file valid (`inventory/hosts.yml`) ✅
- [ ] **Change default token in `defaults/main.yml`** ⚠️
- [ ] VMs provisioned (`task provision`)
- [ ] SSH connectivity (`task ping`)
- [ ] Ready to deploy! (`task rke2`)

## 🎉 Summary

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND READY**

- Role properly installed from GitHub
- Playbook syntax verified
- Documentation updated
- Configuration integrated
- Ready for deployment

**Next Step**: 
```bash
task cluster
```

This will:
1. Provision your 6 VMs (3 masters, 3 workers)
2. Deploy RKE2 cluster
3. Verify cluster health
4. Display access instructions

**Enjoy your RKE2 cluster!** 🚀
